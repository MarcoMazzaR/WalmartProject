#DATA MANIPULATION:



	EXCEL: 
		When opening the file, I noticed that the format of some columns was incorrect, so I changed the type and decided to continue in SQL.

	SQL: 
		Manipulation and cleaning of data. Creation of tables/temp tables to make comparisons between operations and data from the original table. 
		Transformation of date data to break it down into year, month, fortnight, and day to perform more detailed analysis.

	POWER BI: 
		Creation of measures to calculate shipping delays and total sales.

#DATA VISUALIZATION:


	POWER BI:
		Use of graphics trying to maintain simplicity for the correct interpretation of data.
		Implementation of the Drill Down function to perform a more in-depth exploration.
		Buttons for navigation between different dashboards.
		Conservation of 3 basic KPIs throughout the 3 dashboards for comparisons.
		Customer and order tables to track operations and have a more detailed analysis.

	#DISCLAIMER: 
		In the Monthly Income chart, I am aware that the format is not the most suitable, 
		but for space reasons and to maintain a clear and harmonious presentation, I opted for the funnel chart, although the optimal one would have been a line chart.
